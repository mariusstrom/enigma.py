# Enigma
I'm learning Python, so might as well write an Enigma machine in Python.

Go easy on me. Feedback on poor Python habits helpful. Making fun of poor Python habits not helpful.

## Goals
- [x] Emulation of M3 Enigma machine with authentic rotor behavior
- [ ] Rotors rotate at correct spots
- [x] Configure *Walzenlage*
  - [ ] Allow user configuration of *walzenlage* at runtime
- [ ] Configure *Ringstellung*
  - [ ] Allow user configuration of *ringstellung* at runtime
